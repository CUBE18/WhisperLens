# WhisperLens

**WhisperLens** is an open-source AI-powered voice-to-text and sentiment insight toolkit focused on low-resource languages. It helps developers, educators, and nonprofits build voice-enabled applications for local communities — with privacy and inclusivity at its core.

## 🔍 What It Does

- 🎤 Transcribes audio using fine-tuned Whisper models
- 💬 Performs lightweight NLP sentiment tagging
- 🌍 Supports Indian languages like Kannada, Telugu, Tamil (more coming)
- 🧩 Easy-to-use APIs and web dashboard
- 🔐 Runs locally — no cloud required

## 🚀 Vision

To democratize voice AI by empowering underrepresented languages and communities through open-source innovation.

## 💡 Why WhisperLens?

Most voice-AI tools are not built for low-resource languages. WhisperLens bridges that gap by:
- Supporting local language datasets
- Running inference offline
- Open-sourcing the entire tech stack
